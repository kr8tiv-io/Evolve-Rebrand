# EVOLVE | Eco Surface Prep & Restoration

> **Precision. Preservation. Performance.**

**Evolve** is the signal in the noise. We are not just a surface restoration company; we are the reset button for industrial infrastructure. Born in the Boreal forest and built for the high-tech frontier, we bridge the gap between rugged utility and surgical precision.

## 🌲 The Philosophy: Backcountry Cyberpunk

The industrial landscape is littered with "Corporate Noise"—cluttered designs and toxic processes. Evolve represents the **Industrial Rebirth**.
- **The Engine (E):** Forward motion and technological evolution.
- **The Tree:** Protecting the substrate and the environment.
- **The Kinetic Swish:** Controlled chaos; the supersonic precision of our blast trail.

## 🛠 Capabilities

We deliver dustless vapor blasting, steam washing, and restoration for:

*   **Industrial (The Skeptic):** Zero spark risk, zero hazmat cleanup, exact SSPC profiling.
*   **Commercial (The Visionary):** Restoring architectural finishes overnight without disruption.
*   **Residential (The Protector):** Dustless, non-toxic restoration that respects the home.

## 💻 The Digital Experience

This repository hosts the static site for **evolution.contractors**, designed with our "Dark Mode" aesthetic:
*   **Palette:** Boreal Void (`#0a0a0a`) & Aurora Neon (`#4ade80`).
*   **Atmosphere:** A global noise overlay simulating the "Anchor Profile" of blasted steel.
*   **Typography:** *Neue Montreal* (Architectural) & *JetBrains Mono* (Technical).
